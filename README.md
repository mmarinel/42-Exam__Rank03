micropaint &amp; minipaint ---42RomaLuiss Exam rank 03!

type "make test" in each directory to execute the program on a given input (type your desired instructions in the vim editor that will be open and don't forget to save!)

Also, each make creates another file which is the compressed version of the three files present in the current directory (minipaint/micropaint). This file will then be moved to the  ../../examRank-03_Tester/[mini_paint|micropaint]/ directory ready to be fed to the tester!
(So, if you want to use the tester, get it from Glagan: https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03.git and put it in the directory listed above!)
