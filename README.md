micropaint &amp; minipaint ---42RomaLuiss Exam rank 03!

type "make test" in each sub-directory to execute the program on a given input--type your desired instructions in the vim editor that will be opened (and don't forget to save!)

type "make testall" in each sub-directory to execute the program against the Glagan Tester ( https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03.git ). The original tester doesn't stop until it finds an error; we instead stop it after TESTING_TIME secs have passed (you can set this variable inside the Makefile).

Also, each "make" creates another file which is the compressed version of the three files present in the current sub-directory (minipaint/micropaint). This file will be then moved to the  ../../examRank-03_Tester/[mini_paint|micropaint]/ directory...ready to be fed to the tester!
(So, if you want to use the tester, get it from Glagan: https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03.git and put it in the directory listed above!)
