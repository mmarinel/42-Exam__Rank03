- type "make test" in each sub-directory to execute the program on a given input--type your desired instructions in the vim editor that will be opened (and don't forget to save!)

- type "make testall" in each sub-directory to execute the program against the Glagan Tester ( https://github.com/Glagan/42-exam-rank-03.git ). The original tester doesn't stop until it finds an error. Through my Makefile, instead, you can stop it after TESTING_TIME secs have passed without finding any errors (you can set this variable inside the Makefile).

**dont't forget to `brew install coreutils` if you want to use the "testall" rule!**

If you want to exercise, try cloning this repo and overwrite my source files with yours!
